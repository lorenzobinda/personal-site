# My personal website
It's online on [lorenzobinda.com](https://lorenzobinda.com/)
It contains articles and guides created by me. It's focused on technology and productivity tools. Here I express my personal opinions, I hope it will be useful also for others. 

Created with the Hugo static website generator, starting from the hugo-coder theme. 

All made by me in my spare time. The journey has been an extremely valuable way to really go deep and put my coding competences into practice.
