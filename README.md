# My personal website
It will contain articles and guides created by me. Will be focused on technology and productivity tools. It's full of personal opinions, but I hope it will be useful also for others. 

Created with the Hugo static website generator, starting from the hugo-coder theme. 

All made by me in my spare time. The journey has been an extremely valuable way to really go deep and put my coding competences into practice.
