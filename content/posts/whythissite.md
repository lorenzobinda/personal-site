I always wanted to create a free space where to express myself and discuss ideas. I want to set up something that is 100% mine, something not owned by a big tech company like The Four (Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple). With these goals in mind, lorenzo.com was born.

3 were the factors made me start: 
- pandemic that gave us a lot of time to spend at home;
- the willingness to learn something new and valuable;
- demonstrate to myself that I would be able to do it.

I like coding and I could have continued watching tutorials and studying the documentation, but in reality, you learn a lot more when you act and try to experiment and build things on your own. 

This website is a journey that I started and even though nobody would read these pages, the time spent will still be valuable for me.


## This website is the result of a 90-days challenge I set up against myself.

I decided to set up a challenge because I needed a system to maintain interest and forced me to work also on the days where you just want to lay in bed and be a complete wasteman. 
As I have learned from James Clear:
> Forget about setting goals. Focus on systems instead.

The importance is not in what you want to achieve, but in maintaining the momentum to work every day and compound your results over time.

Lastly, the final nudge that convinced me to complete the work arrived thanks to Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon. The small book is a quick guide on how and why you should start sharing your best self online.


## In-depth with technical aspects.

This website has been created using HUGO: a completely free and open-source static website generator. Once I had learnt the basics I started building the actual site based on the Coder theme, on top of which I have made some major adjustments for my purpose. 

During this time I learnt:
- HTML and CSS in-depth (also SCSS to be more precise)
- the HUGO framework and how to structure a static website
- YAML and TOML languages
- GitHub and Git functioning and basic principles
- how the website hosting works, in my case via Netlify
- the custom domain world


## Conclusion.

It was a long project and it was not always easy, but I am very happy with the results until now, and most importantly I have enjoyed the journey before the destination. 

Start now! "The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something!‚Äù
