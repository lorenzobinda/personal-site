## Why you should read.

In nowadays world finding the adequate time to stop and start to read seems impossible. Commitments are too many and our attention is easily absorbed by our smartphones and socials. But why you still should read?

Reading is fundamental, it is the activity that has the strongest impact on our brain, and has the ability to shape our ego and the way we think. 
Reading has also incredible advantages: if you read just 5 pages each day, you will be a step ahead of 95% of the whole society. You will be a member of a club with just 5% of the whole population!
Furthermore, reading has many benefits on your mental health (I suggest you [this article](https://comfyliving.net/reading-statistics/#interesting-facts-about-reading-and-mental-health) if you want to know more).

Are you still not convinced? Let’s make this reasoning together: at this moment you are “just one step away” from learning everything you need to improve a specific area of your life. With the right book you can learn whatever you want, and by reading many books you can become an expert in any field. This can change your life forever, and I’m not the only one that agrees: think about Bill Gates that spends weeks alone to read, and Elon Musk that learned how to build a rocket by reading the right books ([his words, not mine](https://www.inc.com/marissa-levin/reading-habits-of-the-most-successful-leaders-that.html)).

That said, what you are waiting for, it’s time to start reading seriously. No excuses.


## My technique for reading 20+ books in a year

I know, this objective seems unachievable for a person that he’s not used to reading, but in reality, it’s closer than you think.
Let’s make some calculations together: if we consider that on average the length of a book is 250 pages (60.000 words), globally we have 5.000 pages a year, with an average reading speed of 250 words/minute, we conclude that we need to read for 80 hours a year. 
At first sight, this seems an enormous amount, but if we think closely it’s like reading for 13 minutes each day: I don’t think this is impossible considering that on average we pass 3 hours on our phone…

Numbers aside, this is the technique that I used to pass from 0 to 20 books read in a year: 

##### 1. The first step is the steepest.
Starting is always difficult, the first 3-4 books are fundamental. Choose a topic you are interested in, something that attracts you in this specific moment of your life. 
The first book that worked for me was the biography of Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance; I wanted to know more about this man, and here I found the solution. 
Another possible way is to think about the challenges you are facing right now, and whatever the situation you are in, I’m sure you will manage to find a book that will help. 

Remember, there’s a book for everything. You are “just one book away”

##### 2. Find a moment for yourself. 
Build your reading habit. Start by finding out a moment of your day dedicated to reading, a small spot. Personally, I prefer to read at night, before going to bed.

##### 3. Read at least one page every day.
It doesn’t matter how tired you are, those are excuses, start to read your daily page. In order to consolidate a real routine you must show up every day: so pick up a book, open it, and read 2 rows. What matters is that you do it daily, this is the only way to make reading a real habit for you, something you will do without thinking about it.

##### 4. Take notes.
Reading can be both a relaxing moment and a growth one: for this reason, you need to underline the best passages and transcribe them. By doing that you will have a way to go back and search a line whenever you need advice. 

##### 5. Narrate what you read.
When you find a fascinating book, speak about it with your friends, this is a fantastic conversation starter. In addition by doing so, you will retain and remember more from what you read. 

##### 6. Quit books.
If a book doesn’t get you, quit it. Reading has to be pleasing, if a book fails in this mission is time to stop. We will not live forever, you will be able to read only a finite number of books, quit the ones that are not worth it.

##### 7. Make books work for you.
Do not stop, reading is just the starting point, try to apply the books’ insights to your daily life.


## Reading is just the first step.

Now that you are an avid reader, the next challenge for you is to try to retain as much as possible from each book, in a way that can help you with your everyday life. But this is not easy, for the first 2 years I struggled a lot in doing so, time passes and we cannot remember forever.

But don’t worry, there are solutions also for this issue, and take notes it’s just one of the possible beginnings. In one of the next posts, I will show you my Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system, a method for retaining and organize all the valuable information you encountered in your life. There are a lot of methods and software for doing so, I will show you mine, and you are free to copy it, change it and suggest improvements if you like.
