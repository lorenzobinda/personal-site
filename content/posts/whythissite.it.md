Da sempre desideravo costruirmi un mio piccolo spazio dove esprimermi...

I always wanted to create a free space where to express myself and discuss ideas. I want to set up something that is 100% mine, something not owned by a big tech company.
With these goals in mind, **lorenzo.com** is born.

3 factors made me start:
- pandemic, that gave us a lot of time to spend at home;
- the willingness to **learn something new and valuable**;
- demonstrate to myself that I would be able to do it.

I like coding and I could have continued to watch tutorials and study the documentation, but in reality, *you learn a lot more when you act and try to experiment and build things on your own*.

This website is a journey that I started. Even though nobody would read these pages, the time spent will be still valuable for me.


## This website is the result of a 90-days challenge I set up against myself.

I decided to set up a challenge because I needed a system to maintain interest and forcing me to work also on the days where you just want to lay in bed and be a completely wasteman.
As I have learned from James Clear:
> Forget about setting goals. Focus on systems instead.

The importance is not in what you want to achieve, but it is in **maintaining the momentum** to work every day and compound your results over time.
