**TLDR (Too Long Didn‚Äôt Read):**
-	Why yes: privacy, better apps, better support.
-	Why no: proprietary ecosystem, prices, USB type C absent.
-	Google‚Äôs problem and too few alternatives.

I use Android since forever, I had Samsung, LG, Huawei, and Xiaomi phones, at the moment I settled with a OnePlus 5T in December 2017. And to be honest, I am quite happy with my actual smartphone, even though the battery and the cameras are beginning to show their age: almost 4 years.

But why do **I have in mind to switch to Apple**, to the dark side of the Force, the side of the ‚Äúcool‚Äù people that are not technology-savvy? I will try to explain it in this article, and in the meanwhile, I hope to clarify the ideas I have in mind.

## Why yes.

The main reason: **privacy**. Nowadays privacy seems an outdated term, something that we know will be violated by the big tech companies, but I don‚Äôt think this is right and we should abandon it without fighting. In our smartphones we have the 90% of our lives, and Apple seems to be the only company that cares about it and doesn‚Äôt want to collect and sell our data to everyone.

The second reason are the **more refined Apps**, and this is objective: iOS developers are far more careful than Android ones because they know that they have a bigger market where users usually buy their Apps and do not sideload them. Sometimes, even Google offers a more polished version of its Apps (Gmail, Maps, Meet, ‚Ä¶) on iOS.

The third big motivation is the **support**, on iOS you receive updates on day one, you always have the latest features, and you don‚Äôt have to wait for ages to switch from one software version to the next one, like on Android happens (to switch from Android 9 to 10 on my OnePlus phone, I had to wait 14 months since the Android 10 presentation üò®). Also, the longevity of the support has no equal: iPhone 6s still gets the latest software updates, and 6 years have passed since its release.

*And we must pay attention that those are not strange requests coming from a tech enthusiast; being on the latest version means be sure to have the latest **security updates** and important bugs fixed that can damage our phone and put our information at risk.

## Why no.

Coming now to the negative aspects and to the reasons that refrain me to switch to iOS.

First is the **proprietary ecosystem**, which is both a pro and a con: the positive aspect is all the accessories, covers, and the particular attention on your device. But the problem is that you are closed in a golden cage, Apple establishes all for you: no personalization, no possibility to change App icons, the launcher, the User Interface appearance‚Ä¶ The style is dictated by Apple and you cannot escape.

The other big reason is obviously the **price**: fixed and stable, small discounts only come after months. The price is for sure the biggest entry barrier of the new iPhones, there are no middle and low-budget iPhones (unless you settle with the previous models or you have big compromises with the SE series).

Lastly, we have the issue that is the easiest to solve, but that drives me mad the most: the **Lightning port**, Apple stop, please! It‚Äôs time to have a standard, it‚Äôs time to switch to the USB type C. 

## The issue with Google

Another big reason that convinced me to evaluate Apple as a possibility are Google‚Äôs demerits: the poor attention that the Mountain View company puts in its product and its Operative System. On Android there is too little control, each manufacturing company works for itself and does not care about the others; the result: **never coming features**, and poor communication between the devices. Also, the different APIs that each company uses result in App not well optimized (the worst and most famous example is Instagram for Android) and updates that come after ages.

To add another problem, there is also Google itself. **For Google you are the product**, they sell advertising and so your data are a gold mine. In fact, on average an Android phone sends to Google 20 times the amount of data that an iPhone sends to Apple.

## Conclusions
After all, is switching to Apple worth it? Would you do that, also considering the few available alternatives (Chinese phones, Samsung, and Google Pixels)?

My question still holds, and for sure the not-so-exciting iPhone 13 helped me to take a final decision!
