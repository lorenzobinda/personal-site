This is the first episode of a new series: the "Best of the Week". 
The objective is to shortly collect and analyze the latest Technology news and then share the best ideas that I encountered/learned this week. 

The hope is that it will be useful to you, both to stay updated and to advance your reasoning on a specific topic.

Simply this is the Best of this Week!


## The news!

#### 1. Facebook and Rayban jointly presented their new smart glasses.
Would Facebook be able to succeed where Google failed 8-years ago?
Is the collab with Essilor-Luxottica the right move?

Many unanswered questions for the presentation of the Ray-Ban Stories, the only thing we know is that they are a new type of glasses with integrated cameras and speakers. They will be able to record short videos, take calls and listen to music. 

Nothing futuristic like the Google Glasses were: in fact, there is no optical display inside the glasses. But the advantages for Luxottica and Facebook are clear: the classical Ray-Ban style and a more affordable price (only 299$, instead of 1.500$ for the Google Glasses back in 2013). 

Will the product become mainstream? Would you like to buy a pair? 


## The insights!

#### 1. Tesla AI day
Simply one of the best AI presentations that you can find online. A complete explanation about Tesla AI works and why they are one of the most advanced companies in the world.

Be aware: it's very technical!

Small spoiler: there is also a Tesla Bot! 

#### 2. The books summaries by James Clear
If you don't know who James Clear is, I blame you: it's time to start! If you already know him, nice!

Anyway checking his books summaries is valuable in both cases: a lot of insights there!

#### 3. The Farnam Street blog
This week I discovered and started looking at the "Farnam Street" blog by [Shane Parrish](https://twitter.com/ShaneAParrish).
It's simply amazing, one of the best blogs ever seen: a load of quality content.

#### 4. The podcast RIP thoughts: "Il Filo di Arianna" series (Only in Italian!)

A series of episodes about finance and the value of money, a good starting point for in-depth reasoning of our relationships with money.

It's hosted by Mr RIP, an ex-Google developer with an English blog about Financial Independence and Early Retirement: [RetireInProgress](https://retireinprogress.com/).
