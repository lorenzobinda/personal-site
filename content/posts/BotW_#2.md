Here we are, second episode of the "Best of the Week". 
As usual, the objective is to shortly collect and analyze the latest Technology news and then share the best ideas that I encountered/learned this week. 

## The news!

#### 1. Apple event: new iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches!

In case you miss it (really?!), you can find a quick summary here:

My opinion? A disappointing event. As usual a great presentation with spectacular images and drone shots, but this year the products are really not very interesting. Very very few innovations.

Apple is demonstrating to be really conservative, and this year the Wow factor is totally absent. The "one more thing" moments of Steve are farther than ever. The product are really good, but users are expecting something more. Or not? We, as tech enthusiast, are surely looking for more, but Apple sales are increasing, and this demonstrates that the average user is happy with what is getting now... What a pity.

Best product: iPad mini. In the meantime we'll wait for the first reviews.

#### 2. Inspiration 4 mission

For the first time in history, 4 civilians in orbit (for 3 days ðŸ¤¯): I am speachless. SpaceX is ages ahead of the others and it won't stop.

They are the only possibility we have for going back to the Moon and reaching Mars.

Sono loro l'unica speranza che abbiamo per tornare sulla Luna e andare su Marte.

I really suggest the Netflix series that narrates all the story of the mission.

## The insights!

#### 1. The movie Dune

Wow! Finally a movie that is worth watching!

A movie that creates hype and put the basis for a huge saga. I'm in hype for the second episode and in the meanwhile I will for sure read the books.

My suggestion: don't miss it, you need to watch it!
