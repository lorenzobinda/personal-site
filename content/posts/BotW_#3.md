Third episode of the "Best of the Week". 
As usual, the objective is to shortly collect and analyze the latest Technology news and then share the best ideas that I encountered/learned this week. 

## The news!

#### 1. Microsoft event: new Surfaces!

On wednesday Microsoft presented their new devices of the Surface line:

Let's start with the Pro8: new design, new processors, new 120hz screen, Thuderbolt 4 ports and a new stylus. A big upgrade in respect to the past years, now it's really an overall complete product: it has nothing less than an iPad Pro and as an advantage, it has a fully specced operating system.

Surface Laptop Studio, a completely new product with a bizarre design and a screen that folds over the keyboard; interesting but we need to see more.

Surface Duo 2, after the big failure of the first version, the folding smartphone is back: but will the software be better than last year? If the OS is not polished enough, it's better to stay away from it...

And many more products (noticeable the Adaptive Kit for improving the usability for disable people).

#### 2. China banned all the crypto-currencies

I report the news without going too much in the details: [China ban shows crypto cons and a pro](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/china-ban-shows-crypto-cons-pro-2021-09-24/).

## The insights!

#### 1. Best video about climate change

This week I suggest you to go and watch the Kurzgesagt's (a scientific youtube channel) video about climate change: a rare pearl!

#### 2. Naval Ravikant's interview on the JRE podcast

I know that it's an episode from 2 years ago, but it's really worth. Full of insights and interesting ideas. I post here some of the bests for me:
- Status is a zero-sum game, in order to gain a new level, you have to pull someone down. Wealth is a positive-sum game, everybody can reach it.
- Socialism comes from the heart, we all want to be socialist. Capitalism comes from the head, because there will always be cheaters. When you are young if you are not socialist you have no heart, when you are older if you're not a capitalist you have no head, you haven't thought it through.
- “Every man has two lives, and the second starts when he realizes he has just one” — Confucius
