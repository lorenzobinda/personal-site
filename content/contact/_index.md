## About me
👨🏻‍🎓 I'm a **management engineering student** at Politecnico of Milan in my 5th year. 

💻 My number one obsession is **technology**, I'm interested in every aspect of it. I like coding, learning, following new developments, but the best part of it is discovering new Apps that can *improve my workflow and life management*. 

📚 In my spare time I like **reading**. For each book I read, *I take notes and combine them* together with articles I read, videos I watched, and other personal reflections. 

🚀 My secret passion is **space exploration**: I constantly check when the next space mission will be!
